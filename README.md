The round drew participation from a wide array of investors, including Lightspeed Faction, Bankless Ventures, and Wintermute Ventures. Angel investors included Sreeram Kannan of EigenLayer and Alex Atallah of OpenRouter.

It brings the companyâ€™s total funding to $20 million as it seeks to expand its footprint in the burgeoning AI and Web3 markets, the company said in a statement

The San Francisco-based firm is building a decentralized GPU marketplace and offering verifiable AI inference services, addressing what it sees as a critical shortage of accessible and affordable computing power for developers and researchers.
